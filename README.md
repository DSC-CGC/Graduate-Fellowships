This fellowship seeks to fully support a small group of the most promising PhD students in AI and ML who are interested in making the long-term, large-scale impacts of AI a central focus of their research. Students with pre-existing funding sources who find the mission and community of the Fellows Program appealing are welcome to apply. We are committed to fostering a culture of inclusion, and encourage individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences to apply; we especially encourage applications from qualified women and minorities.
